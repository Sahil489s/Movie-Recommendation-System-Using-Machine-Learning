# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-Machine-Learning
A personalized Movie Recommendation System developed using Python and Scikit-Learn. The project leverages collaborative filtering techniques to deliver tailored movie suggestions based on user viewing patterns and preferences.

Overview
This system aims to recommend movies by analyzing the preferences of various users and finding patterns in their ratings and choices. By employing collaborative filtering, the model effectively predicts and suggests films that match user interests.

Features
Personalization: Recommends movies based on individual preferences.
Scalability: Capable of handling large volumes of data efficiently.
Real-Time Suggestions: Optimized for real-time movie recommendations.
Dataset
The project uses a movie ratings dataset, which contains detailed information about users, movies, and their corresponding ratings. The data underwent preprocessing to ensure optimal model performance.
